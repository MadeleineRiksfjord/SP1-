        <h2>"Explore Together"</h2>
        <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to making science accessible to all.

            <br>

            <br>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
            water,
            and
            earth to
            exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.

            <br>

            <br>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries
            and
            perhaps even
            ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

            <br>


            <br>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is
            why
            we
            have
            over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are
            designed for
            you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they
            only
            come to
            life at night when everyone's gone home).
        </p>
        <h2>Explore</h2>

        <h3>For kids</h3>

        Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, thereâ€™s plenty to see
        and do. <br>

        <br>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our
        resident Woolly
        Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to
        learn
        and
        explore.

        <br>


        <br>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where
        you'll
        get
        to
        explore and experiment with our team of experts.

        <br>

        <br>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go
        on
        a
        journey of
        discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you
        can
        join,
        send us a message.

        <br>

        <h3>For teachers</h3>

        <br>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring.
        Our
        team
        are on
        hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide
        great
        video
        presentations that will excite and inspire them.

        <br>

        <br>Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring
        your
        students
        through for a visit.
