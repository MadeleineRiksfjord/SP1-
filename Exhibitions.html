        <h2>Exhibitions</h2>

        <h3>Cosmology</h3>

        <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and
            what
            we can
            see and know about the universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
            seen
            and
            learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
            <br>

            <br>
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope, to the latest
            exploration
            of the planets in our solar system.
            <br>

            <br>

        <h3>Evolution</h3>


        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from
        and how
        did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and
        understanding
        our place in this world.
        <br>

        <br>

        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can
        also take
        some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a
        number of
        dinosaurs too.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the
        great
        wonders of the tiny world.
        <br>

        <br>

        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
        growth of
        our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at
        some
        major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
        <br>

        <br>

        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
        wild.
        Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
        <br>

        <br>

        <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>

        The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. From
        useful
        home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the
        hand of
        Rob the Robot.
        <br>

        <br>

        <h3>Ecology</h3>

        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that
        scientists
        explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
        <br>

        <br>

        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,
        extinction of
        species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.

        <i>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</i>
        <br>

        <br>

        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science
            Museum.
            <br>
            It's a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness
            them.
            From
            <br>
            solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to
            create
            power.
